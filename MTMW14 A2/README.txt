This is the code for replicating and adapting the Stommel (1948) western 
boundary current model.

Constants.py contains a set of classes which define the parameters being used 
in each model run

Functions.py contains all of the functions which obtain the analytical and
numerical models

Plotting.py contains the code for plotting the outputs of the functions

The code will all run in a Jupyter notebook, Report.ipynb

A pdf copy of the report can be found in the folder as Report.pdf

In case it doesn't render in the notebook or pdf, a png of the Arakawa C grid 
used is found as Arakawa_Grid.png
